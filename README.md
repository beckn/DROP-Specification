# Protocol for Unified Legal Services (PULSE)
## Introduction

The Access to Justice system in India is expansive and fragmented. Various organizations and justicemakers serve different aspects of access to justice, that includes various themes, services or products, and location/jurisdiction. Due to this,  it is important for seekers to access a holistic, unified experience, based on their needs. This includes: 
1. Finding trusted services (lawyers, counselors, social workers, paralegals, mediators, ODR, etc) 
2. Finding necessary products (Titlesearch reports; contract management services, etc) 
3. Enabling seekers and/or justicemakers to create and track a digital record/document of the support sought and the experience of seeking support 
4. Leveraging the data & knowledge through this process to influence trust, decision making, policy, and interventions necessary 

Organizations and justicemakers also seek to be empowered and interconnected with other organizations to provide holistic justice services and expand their reach. Currently, there is seemingly a chasm between the innovation on the ground and legal tech innovation; and each organization and justicemaker that seeks to connect with each other is required to do it individually. <br/>

### Opportunities for the field of Law & Justice
Recognizing the citizen/individual need for a holistic experience in accessing the justice ecosystem, organizations are keen to interconnect and enable  discovery of multiple legal service providers, particularly of services that they themselves do not provide or intend to provide. 

Enabling interconnectedness and discovery of legal service providers helps with: 

1. **Increased discoverability of Legal Service Providers**: While institutions and ecosystems adoption of various legal services is growing exponentially, end individuals aren’t familiar with many legal services. Also, today an end individual can discover a legal service provider only if both of them are on the same platform, this is called "Coincidence of Presence". Legal service providers are naturally discoverable by implementing the protocol as any end user-facing application can access them. That means an individual does not have to specifically sign-up to a Legal Service Provider. They can remain on the application of their choice and discover legal service providers based on a unified/common language. 
2. **Increased choice for individuals**: Users can send personalized search queries to receive customized offerings, including languages, services, and cost, from legal service providers. This also enables various legal service providers to cater to the diverse needs of individuals. 
3. **Lower costs of doing business**: End user platforms can focus on providing the best experience for their users, and provider platforms can focus on better services without having to worry about CAC. <br/>
4. **Non-linear innovation**: Legal service providers can provide value-added services over and above their current offerings by connecting to other downstream networks.  
5. **Secure and consent based data exchange**: Currently, parties to a legal service order are required to manually upload documents multiple times or parties to an order lose time when documents need to be transferred from one platform or place to another. This allows parties to an order to transfer documents as needed, when necessary. Privacy and data security is part of the Protocol design. 
6. **Enhanced trust in transactions & User Experience**: Parties to a legal service order aren’t always able to track their disputes or keep a digital record of online transactions, particularly when a business or enterprise is handling 100s of orders. The protocol enables trust in transactions, allows parties to track status & updates of a dispute, and prioritizes user experience in discovering a provider and initiating a service. <br/>

**About the PULSE Specification** 
To tap into the opportunities described above, a group of volunteers have come together to design a unified protocol to unify the discovery and engagement of various legal services through an interoperable API specification to scale citizen access to justice. PULSE is an adaptation of [Beckn Protocol](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) that establishes a framework to arrive at this  community-owned transaction standard for discovering legal services. Implementing the PULSE protocol will enable ecosystems/institutions seeking various legal services to easily discover and engage with multiple legal service providers.

By virtue of a minimum viable standardized process/steps of communication, it eases the burden of multiple one-to-one integrations of legal service providers with ecosystems/institutions and also enables continuous sharing of status and updates to the respective ecosystem/institution as mutually decided.

### Benefits
This protocol will have multifold benefits across the spectrum of stakeholders. End-users will benefit from easy discovery and access to various legal services, end-to-end tracking, and increased visibility. Legal service providers will see an increased adoption of their services as a method for accessing justice. They will also be able to work with multiple ecosystems and platforms using the PULSE protocol. Instead of managing multiple unique integrations, they can focus more on building their value-added services and meeting ecosystem standards, rather than on navigating unique integrations. Additionally, this process will also supplement the efforts by the court system to streamline access to justice and improve the citizen experience.
